- Hi, I’m @deejaylate! In an attempt to be more professional with my work post military service, I've decided to make a github in order to have a running portfolio of my projects/upskilling. 

<!---
deejaylate/deejaylate is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
